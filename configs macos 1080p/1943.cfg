## Configured for 1080p - you need to adjust the following parameters to your screen resolution:
## custom_viewport_width - the vertical screen size
## custom_viewport_height - the horizontal screen size
## custom_viewport_x - the x location of your screen, upper left corner
## custom_viewport_y - the y location of your screen, upper left corner
## If your screen is 16:9, you can just apply a factor compared to the 1080p resolution. In case of my iMac late 2013, this is 1.33.
## No game specific Video Shaders included here.
